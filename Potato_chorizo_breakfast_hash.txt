Ingredients
1 large onion
1 clove of garlic
120 g quality chorizo
2-3 cooked potatoes
1/2 bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley
olive oil
2 large free-range eggs

Method
Preheat the oven to 180ÂºC/gas 4.
Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, chop the chorizo, dice up the cooked potato and pick and finely chop the parsley.
Gently fry the onion and garlic in a little oil in an ovenproof pan until the onion is soft. Add the chorizo and fry for 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the potatoes and cook for 5 minutes more, then crack the eggs on top.
Transfer the pan to the preheated oven and bake for 8 minutes, or until the egg white is set but the yolk is still runny.
Sprinkle with sea salt, black pepper and the parsley, to serve.
